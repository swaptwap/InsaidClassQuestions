1. Decision tree- When to decide if tree is overfitting or underfitting?
2. Identify overfitting by entropy.
3. how to calculate bias and variance?- need to check.. 
4. why we are using log in entropy formula?- 
5. How to decide when to use log and when to square in all formlaes which we use for any calculations of different models?
6. If we have 100 columns in dataset, then what is ~ range to predict if model is underfit or overfit depending on number of columns used
7. Model should be more stable model or more accurate?
8. How to decide which is better model?
9. What is ensemble term in random forest?
10. Does decreasing of rows from dataset does not impact the accuracy of model? 
11. What are the advantages of using Random forest model?
12. What are the terms Pruning and unpruning means?
