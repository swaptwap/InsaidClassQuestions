1. Decision tree- When to decide if tree is overfitting or underfitting?
level < 2- under fitting
level > 4 overfitting.

2. Identify overfitting by entropy.
if we draw the tree till entropy=0 then it is overfitting

3. how to calculate bias and variance?
bias: bias is how much mean prediction differs from various actual values
variance: dispersion of prediction from actual

4. why we are using log in entropy formula?- 
to bring range between 0-1 as log to the base 2. we are trying to add weight.

5. How to decide when to use log and when to square in all formlaes which we use for any calculations of different models?
if data is changing and distribution are changing much- go for square.
if data is not changing much- we use log. its keeps data consistent. 

6. If we have 100 columns in dataset, then what is ~ range to predict if model is underfit or overfit depending on number of columns used
if 90 used in one root and 10 in other.. 10 one is underfit.. 90 is overfit..
ideally it should be 60-40 etc,

7. Model should be more stable model or more accurate?
we should go for more stable model and not most accurate model.

8. How to decide which is better model?
try all possible values with gridsearch cv
then compare the bias and variance and select the one with least bais and least variance

9. What is ensemble term in random forest?
Create n decision trees, select random nodes and then use decision trees.

10. Does decreasing of rows from dataset does not impact the accuracy of model? 
does decreasing of rows not impact the accuracy? or we dont know?- We dont knw is the answer

11. What are the advantages of using Random forest model?
- no overfitting
- handles missing data
- high accuracy.

12. What are the terms Pruning and unpruning means?
